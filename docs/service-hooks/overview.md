# Integrate with service hooks

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Service Hooks let you run tasks on other services when events happen in your project in Azure DevOps.

For example, you can create a card in Trello when a work item gets created or send a push notification to your team's mobile devices when a build fails. You can also use service hooks in custom apps and services as a more efficient way to drive activities when events happen in your projects.

## How do service hooks work?

Service hook **publishers** define a set of *events* that you can subscribe to. 
**Subscriptions** listen for these *events* and define **actions** to take based on the event. 

Subscriptions also target **consumers**, which are external services that can run their own actions 
when events occur.

> [!NOTE]
> Service hooks require allowing IP ranges for inbound connection to service endpoints. The service endpoint is the set of properties provided to a service hook. For more information, see [Allowed address lists and network connections, IP addresses and range restrictions](../organizations/security/allow-list-ip-url.md#range-restrictions).

## Create a subscription

When you integrate one of these services with Azure DevOps, you must create a new subscription. In many cases, you need to do some configuration in the other service, too. For specific details, check out the information for the service that you're interested in.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1.	Open the admin page for a project in web access.
    
    <img alt="Screenshot of highlighted Project settings button." src="./media/devops-service-hooks.png" />

1. 	Run the wizard to create the subscription.

    ![Screenshot of highlighted button, Create subscription.](./media/devops-create-subscription.png)
 
1.	Select the service that you want to integrate with.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/select-service.png" alt-text="Select the service to integrate":::   
 
1.	Select the event to trigger on and any applicable filters.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/trello-wizard-event.png" alt-text="Select the event to trigger on and any filters":::  
 
1.	Select an action to run on the target service. 

	> [!NOTE]
    > The list of available actions may be limited based on the event type that you selected. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/trello-wizard-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing selection of an action for the target service.":::  

1.	To confirm the settings are correct, test the subscription and then finish the wizard.

## FAQs

<a id="subscription-permissions"></a>

### Q: What permissions do I need to set up a subscription?

A: *Edit subscriptions* and *View subscriptions*. By default, only project administrators 
have these permissions. To grant them to other users directly, you can use the [command line tool](../organizations/security/manage-tokens-namespaces.md) or the [Security](/rest/api/azure/devops/security/) REST API. 

To grant *View* permission for a group, see [Set *View* permission for a group in Service Hooks](view-permission.md) page.

### Q: What are the security implications of granting *Edit subscriptions* and *View subscriptions* permissions?

A: The user with these permissions can see all subscriptions created in the 
project and the notification history for those subscriptions. That user can then 
create any type of service hook subscription in that project. If the user sets up a subscription for a resource that they don't otherwise have permission to access, the subscription won't be triggered. 

**For example:** 
Subscriptions you create for work item update events in area path XYZ won't send notifications if you lack access to those work items. However, you can see the notification history of other users who do have access to those work items.

### Q: Can I create service hook subscriptions for a project programmatically?

A: Yes. For more information, see [Create a service hooks subscription](create-subscription.md).

### Q: Can I remove an app's access to my organization after I've authorized it?

A: Yes. You can revoke authorizations from your profile.

1. 	Go to your profile page from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/. 

	Make sure you start from the Visual Studio site (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) 
	instead of your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{orgName}```) because your profile accessed from your organization takes you to the wrong implementation 
	of the authorizations management feature.

2.	Manage your authorizations.

3.	Revoke any authorizations you no longer want to allow.

	:::image type="content" source="media/authorizations.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Revoke option for authorizations.":::
	
### Q: Why can't we set up service hooks for HipChat anymore?

A: Atlassian officially dropped support for HipChat. For more information, see [the announcement](https://www.atlassian.com/partnerships/slack/faq#faq-3ccc5a61-711b-4ef2-9ca2-3a34b2ec143b).
