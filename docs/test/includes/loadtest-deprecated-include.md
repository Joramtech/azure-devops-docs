> [!NOTE]  
> The Azure DevOps cloud-based load testing service is deprecated, but **Azure Load Testing** remains available. This fully managed load testing service allows you to generate high-scale load using your existing Apache JMeter scripts. For more information, see [What is Azure Load Testing?](/azure/load-testing/overview-what-is-azure-load-testing) and [Changes to load test functionality in Visual Studio and cloud load testing in Azure DevOps](/azure/load-testing/overview-what-is-azure-load-testing).
