> [!IMPORTANT]  
> - Deleting **Area Paths** or reconfiguring **Iteration Paths** causes irreversible data loss. For example, burndown and burnup widget charts, sprint burndown, and velocity charts for teams with changed **Area Paths** won't display accurate data. Historical trend charts reference the **Area Path** and **Iteration Path** as they were defined at the time for each work item. Once deleted, you can't retrieve historical data for these paths.
> - You can only delete area and iteration paths that are no longer used by any work items.
