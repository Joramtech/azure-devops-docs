#### [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio/)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We strongly recommend that everyone use the [default view](../work-items/view-add-work-items.md#view-work-items) instead of this legacy view. It is designed for you to quickly access a list of work items based on your assignment, following, mentioned, or recent updates. The legacy view is no longer being enhanced and we expect to remove it in a future release of Visual Studio.

1. From the Team Explorer home page, choose **Work Items**.
