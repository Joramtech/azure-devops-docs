These differences result from updates made to your web app, options that you or your administrator enabled, and which process was chosen when creating your project: [Agile](../work-items/guidance/agile-process.md), [Basic](../get-started/plan-track-work.md), [Scrum](../work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md), or [CMMI](../work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md). The Basic process is available with [Azure DevOps Server 2019 Update 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2097609) and later versions.
