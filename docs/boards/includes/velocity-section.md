## Velocity

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

When you assign your backlog items to sprints, you gain access to an in-context velocity report for both product and portfolio backlogs. Velocity helps teams determine how much work they can perform sprint-over-sprint.

You can configure the Velocity report to count work items or sum Story Points, Effort, Remaining Work or other numeric field.

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2020"

When you assign your product backlog items to sprints, you gain access to an in-context velocity report for your product backlog. Velocity helps teams determine how much work they can perform sprint-over-sprint.  

The report tracks the team's estimated backlog work that your team has completed (green) in the previous sprints, or that are still in progress (blue). The estimated backlog is the sum of Effort (Basic or Scrum processes), Story Points (Agile process), or Size (CMMI process).
