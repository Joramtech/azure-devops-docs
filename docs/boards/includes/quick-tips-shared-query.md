[View and run queries](../queries/view-run-query.md) from the web portal or from the Team Explorer plug-in for Visual Studio. Modify a query using the [query editor to apply different filter criteria](../queries/using-queries.md) and [add queries to team dashboards](../../report/dashboards/dashboards.md).  

### Tips for shared queries

Enhance your workflow using the following tips:

- Add **@Me** as the value for the Assigned To field in a query clause to find work items assigned to you.
- [Open the query editor](../queries/using-queries.md) to modify any query by adding criteria for a product area, iteration, or another field.
- [Open a query in Excel](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md) to update fields of one or more work items and publish changes to the database.
- [Create a pie-chart, column chart, or trend chart](../../report/dashboards/charts.md) to visualize status or progress for flat-list queries.
- Create queries and folders under the **My Queries** area with standard access. To create queries and folders under **Shared Queries**, ensure you have the Contribute permission and at least Basic access. For more information, see [Set permissions on queries](../queries/set-query-permissions.md).
