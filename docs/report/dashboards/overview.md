# About dashboards, charts, reports, and widgets

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Gain visibility into your team's progress by adding one or more widgets or charts to your dashboard. Customizable, highly configurable dashboards provide you and your teams with the flexibility to share information, monitor progress and trends, and improve your workflow processes. Each team can tailor their dashboards to share information and monitor their progress.

If you're just starting out, read [Add, rename, and delete dashboards](dashboards.md). Looking for instructions on a specific task, in-context chart, widget, or report? See [Dashboards, charts, and quick reference](quick-ref.md). For more information, see the [Reporting roadmap](../powerbi/reporting-roadmap.md).

## Supported capabilities, permissions, and access

Access to Azure DevOps web portal features are managed through access levels assigned to users.

### Web portal data views and reports

The following features provide support for viewing Azure DevOps data through the web portal:

- **Dashboards**: Customizable interactive signboards that provide real-time information. Dashboards are associated with a team or a project and display configurable charts and widgets.
- **Charts**: Query-based status or trend charts derived from a work item query or test results.
- **Widgets**: Items that display configurable information and charts on dashboards. The widget catalog provides brief descriptions of those widgets available to you. Also, you can add widgets provided through [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops).
- **In-context reports**: System-generated charts that support specific services. Examples are team velocity, sprint burndown, the Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD), and the **Test failures** report. These reports are displayed on the **Analytics** tab for a specific service and derive data from Analytics.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

### Power BI reports

The following features provide support for viewing Azure DevOps data by using Power BI:

- **Analytics views**: Provide a simplified way to specify the filter criteria for a Power BI report based on Analytics data for Azure Boards data. For more information, see [About Analytics views](../powerbi/what-are-analytics-views.md).
- **Power BI reports**: Allow users to create rich, customized Power BI reports or other reports using OData queries of Analytics data and the returned JSON data. For on-premises Azure DevOps environments, project collections must be configured to support the Inherited process.

> [!NOTE]
> Open Data Protocol (OData) is an ISO/IEC approved, OASIS standard that defines a set of best practices for building and consuming REST APIs. For more information, see [OData documentation](/odata/).
::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2022"

### SQL Server reports

SQL Server Reporting Services is the legacy reporting solution available with Azure DevOps Server 2020 and earlier versions. The following features provide support for viewing Azure DevOps data by using SQL Server Reports Services and SQL Server Analysis Services.

::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019 < azure-devops-2022"

- **Excel status and trend reports**: Support generating custom work tracking reports by using Excel starting with a flat-list query. For more information, see [Create status and trend reports from a work item query](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/admin/create-status-and-trend-excel-reports).
- **SQL Server reports**: For project collections that support the On-premises XML process model, allow users access to out-of-the-box SQL Server reports and support to create customized SQL reports or Excel reports. Doing so requires that the project is [configured to support SQL Server reporting](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/admin/add-a-report-server).

::: moniker-end  

### Supported features for access levels

Users with **Stakeholder** access get restricted privileges, granting them access to only those features outlined in the following table. For more information, see [About access levels](../../organizations/security/access-levels.md). In addition to access levels, certain features require permissions to execute.

> [!NOTE]
> Data displayed within a chart or widget is subject to permissions granted to the signed-in user. For more information, see [FAQs on Azure DevOps dashboards, charts, and reports](faqs.yml).

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
For Dashboards, set [dashboard permissions](dashboard-permissions.md) at the team level for team dashboards.
::: moniker-end

[!INCLUDE [report dashboard permissions](../../organizations/security/includes/report.md)]

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

[!INCLUDE [analytics dashboard permissions](../../organizations/security/includes/analytics.md)]

::: moniker-end

## Configurable dashboards

With dashboards, you can configure an array of charts and widgets.

Each team can [add and configure multiple dashboards](dashboards.md) to:

- Share information.
- View status, progress, and trends.
- Access quick links and other functions.

Easily add and rearrange widgets on the dashboard to show recent changes made to view build status, bug trends, and more.

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-view-with-widgets.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an example dashboard.":::

#### Sequence for adding and customizing a dashboard

<a id="monitor-progress">  </a>

## Charts: Work tracking status and trends

With flat-list queries, you can create various charts to monitor status, progress, and trends. Before you monitor work progress and trends, [plan your project and make progress on work you're tracking](../../boards/backlogs/create-your-backlog.md).

You can open a shared query, create a chart, and add it to the dashboard. After the chart is added to the dashboard, you can change the **Chart for work items** widget configuration to resize or change the chart parameters. Or, from the dashboard, you can add a **Chart for work items** widget and choose a shared query and set the chart parameters. You have multiple chart types from which to choose. Status charts include pie, bar, column, stacked bar, and pivot. Trend charts include stacked area, line, and area.

For more information, see [Define a query](../../boards/queries/using-queries.md) and [Track progress with status and trend query-based charts](charts.md).

#### Sample Agile tool lightweight charts

::: moniker-end

#### Sequence for adding query-based charts to a dashboard

Select one of the following boxes to open the corresponding article.

[:::image type="content" source="media/gs-chart-query.png" alt-text="Diagram that is a link to Edit query article.":::](../../boards/queries/using-queries.md) [:::image type="content" source="media/gs-chart-create.png" alt-text="Diagram is a link to create a chart article.":::](add-charts-to-dashboard.md) [:::image type="content" source="media/gs-chart-add-dashboard.png" alt-text="Diagram is a link to Add chart to dashboard article.":::](add-charts-to-dashboard.md)

## Charts: Manual testing progress, results, and trends

The steps to creating charts that track manual testing progress and results are similar to the ones for tracking work. The starting point is the test plan rather than a query. For example, you can find out how many test cases are ready to run, or how many tests are passing and failing in each test suite. And, just like work item query-based charts, you can add these charts to a dashboard.

For more information, see:

- [Create test plans and test suites](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md)
- [Create manual test cases](../../test/create-test-cases.md)
- [Track testing progress](../../test/track-test-status.md#charts)

#### Sample lightweight test charts
  
:::image type="content" source="media/gs-monitor-test-charts.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Web Team test plan is a chart showing counts of tests in various stages, with tests broken down by suite.":::

## Widgets

You add widgets to a dashboard to display a chart, information, or set of links. Most widgets are configurable. For a description of each supported widget for your platform and version, see the [Widget catalog](widget-catalog.md). Here are the widgets that support the indicated service.

[!INCLUDE [widget catalog links](../includes/widgets-oob.md)]

### Sprint chart widgets

[:::image type="icon" source="media/widget-sprint-capacity.png":::](widget-catalog.md#sprint-capacity-widget) [:::image type="icon" source="media/widget-sprint-burndown.png":::](widget-catalog.md#sprint-burndown-analytics-widget)

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

### Sprint scope change

There's no chart or widget that tracks changes to sprint scope. However, you can determine work items added to a sprint or moved out of a sprint by using the Query Editor. For more information, see [Query sprint scope changes](../../boards/sprints/scrum-overview.md#sprint-scope-change).

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

### Sample Cumulative Flow Diagram widget
