> The labels for the default Analytics views differ depending on the process that was chosen for your team project: [Basic](../../boards/get-started/what-is-azure-boards.md), [Agile](../../boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process.md), [Scrum](../../boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md), or [CMMI](../../boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md). The functionality available to you remains the same unless explicitly mentioned.
