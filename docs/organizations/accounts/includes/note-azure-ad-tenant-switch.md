> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you change the Microsoft Entra connection, users and groups that inherit membership and permissions from a Microsoft Entra group no longer inherit those permissions. Microsoft Entra groups added to your Azure DevOps organization don't get transferred and cease to exist in your organization. All permissions and membership relationships made with these Microsoft Entra groups also cease to exist after the transfer. Additionally, [group rules](../assign-access-levels-by-group-membership.md) enabled on Microsoft Entra groups cease to exist when you change the Microsoft Entra connection.
