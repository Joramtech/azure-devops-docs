> [!NOTE]  
> When you transition a project to an inherited process, you might encounter Agile tools or work items in an invalid state per the following examples: 
> 
> - If you designate a field as required, work items lacking that field display an error message. To proceed with further changes and save the work item, resolve these errors.
> - If you add, remove, or hide workflow states for a WIT that appears on the board, ensure you update the board column configurations for all teams defined in the  project. Also, consider maintaining single ownership of work items by team area path or formalizing columns with custom states share across teams.
