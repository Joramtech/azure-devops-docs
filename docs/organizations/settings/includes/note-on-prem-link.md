> [!IMPORTANT]   
> The Inheritance process model is available for projects configured to support it. If youâ€™re using an older collection, check the process model compatibility. If your on-premises collection is configured to use the on-premises XML process model, you can only use that process model to customize the work tracking experience. For more information, see [Choose the process model for your project collection](../../../reference/customize-work.md?preserve-view=true&view=azure-devops-2019#choose-process-model).
