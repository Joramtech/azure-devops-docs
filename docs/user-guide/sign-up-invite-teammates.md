# Sign up for Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Sign up for Azure DevOps and get the [free tier of services](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/). For more information, see [What is Azure DevOps?](what-is-azure-devops.md)

## Sign up

Sign up for Azure DevOps with either a Microsoft account or GitHub account.

# [Microsoft account](#tab/microsoft-account)

1. If you don't have one, [create a Microsoft account](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/).
2. Go to [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/) and select **Start free**.
3. Enter your account credentials and go through the sign-up process.

   Azure DevOps creates an organization.
-  Azure DevOps creates a project named after your *newly created* Microsoft account.
-  If you signed up with an existing Microsoft account, you need to [create a project](../organizations/projects/create-project.md) next.

Sign in to your organization at any time `https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization}`.

# [GitHub account](#tab/github-account)

> [!NOTE]
> If your GitHub email address is already associated with an organization in Azure DevOps that's [connected to Microsoft Entra ID](../organizations/accounts/connect-organization-to-azure-ad.md), you can't sign in with your GitHub account. You must sign in with your Microsoft Entra account.

1. If you don't have one, [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
2. Go to [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/) and select **Start free with GitHub**.
3. Enter your account credentials and go through the sign-up process. You're asked to **Authorize Microsoft-corp**.

   Azure DevOps creates an organization. Sign in to your organization at any time `https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization}`.
   Azure DevOps turns on the *Invite GitHub users* policy by default.
