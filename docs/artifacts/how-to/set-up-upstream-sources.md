# Set up upstream sources

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-azure-devops-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

With Azure Artifacts upstream sources, you can streamline your package management by using a single feed to store both the packages you publish and those you consume from external feeds and public registries such as npmjs.com, NuGet.org. When an upstream source is enabled on your feed, Azure Artifacts will automatically save a copy of any package installed by a collaborator or higher from upstream.

> [!NOTE]
> Maven snapshots are not supported in upstream sources.

## Enable upstream sources in a new feed

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then select **Create Feed**.

1. Provide a **Name** for your feed and select its **Visibility** and **Scope** settings. Make sure to check the **Include packages from common public sources** checkbox to enable upstream sources. 
    
1. Select **Create** when you're done.

## Enable upstream sources in an existing feed

1. Select **Add** when you're done, and then select **Save** once more in the top right corner to preserve your changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Custom public upstream sources are only supported with npm registries.

## Add a feed in the same organization as an upstream source

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select the gear icon button![gear icon](../../media/icons/gear-icon.png) to access your feed's settings.

1. Select **Add** when you're done.

        ```
    
    - **Project scoped feed**: 
        
        ```
        azure-feed://ORGANIZATION_NAME/PROJECT_NAME/FEED_NAME@VIEW
