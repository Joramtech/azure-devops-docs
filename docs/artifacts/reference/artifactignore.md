# Use the *.artifactignore* file

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

The `artifactignore` file works similarly to a `gitignore` file but serves a different purpose. Instead of specifying files to be ignored by Git, it's used in Azure Pipelines to control which files are excluded when publishing pipeline artifacts or Universal Packages. This file can help reduce your pipeline execution and improve its efficiency by preventing unnecessary files from being copied into the staging directory before publishing.

The *artifactignore* file has a similar syntax to that of a *gitignore* file and is typically stored in your version control system. However, unlike *gitignore*, the *artifactignore* file doesn't always need to be in the root of your repository. Its location depends on the path specified in the publish task. If placed incorrectly, the task won't recognize it, leading to unintended results. For example, if the path is *$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/bin/artifacts*, the *artifactignore* file should be placed in the */bin/artifacts* directory.

> [!Note]
> The *artifactignore* file does not work with the [Publish Build Artifacts](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-build-artifacts-v1) task, use the [Publish Pipeline Artifacts](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-pipeline-artifact-v1) task instead.

## Syntax

The *.artifactignore* follows the same syntax as the [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) with a few exceptions. The plus sign character `+` is not supported in URL paths, and certain package types, such as Maven, may have limitations with semantic versioning metadata.

> [!Note]
> By default, the *.gitignore* file is ignored unless you have an *.artifactignore* file. To include it, simply create an empty *.artifactignore* file.

## Example

In this example, all files will be ignored except for those located in the *src/MyApp/bin/Release* directory.

```artifactignore
**/*
!src/MyApp/bin/Release/**.*
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The *.artifactignore* file must be placed in the directory specified in the `targetPath` argument in your [Publish Pipeline Artifacts](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-pipeline-artifact-v1) task.
