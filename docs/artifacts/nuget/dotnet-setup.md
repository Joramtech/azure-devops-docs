# Connect to Azure Artifacts feeds (dotnet)

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

Using Azure Artifacts, you can seamlessly publish your NuGet packages to Azure Artifacts feeds so you can share them with others privately or publicly based on your feed's visibility settings. This guide will walk you through setting up your project to authenticate with your Azure Artifacts feed using the dotnet command-line interface.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure DevOps organization and a project. Create an [organization](../../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md) or a [project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md#create-a-project) if you haven't already.

- An Azure Artifacts feed. [Create a new feed](../get-started-nuget.md#create-feed) if you don't have one already.

- Download and install the [Credential provider](https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider).

- Download and install the [.NET Core SDK (2.1.400+)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <configuration>
          <packageSources>
            <clear />
            <add key="<FEED_NAME>" value="https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>/_packaging/<FEED_NAME>/nuget/v3/index.json" />
          </packageSources>
        </configuration>
        ```

    - **Organization-scoped feed**:

        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <configuration>
          <packageSources>
            <clear />
