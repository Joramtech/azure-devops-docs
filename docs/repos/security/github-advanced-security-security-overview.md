#  Security overview 
Security overview provides a single pane of glass to view a summary of your organization's security risk and Advanced Security enablement status. 

All organizations, regardless of if they have an Advanced Security-enabled repository or not, are able to see the security overview tab in their organization settings.

[!INCLUDE [GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps is different from GitHub Advanced Security.](includes/github-advanced-security.md)]

## About security overview
Security overview is available to view for all members of the organization who have access to view organization settings. Under the **Risk** tab, security overview shows you the distribution of total alerts and of alerts by severity across all projects and repositories with Advanced Security enabled under your selected organization. Under the **Coverage** tab, security overview shows the enablement status and navigation to repository settings to quickly enable Advanced Security for any repository. 

## Viewing security insights
To access the security overview for your organization, navigate to **Organization settings > Security overview**. The default view is of the **Risk** tab, which shows a summary of security alerts across dependency scanning, secret scanning, and code scanning in totality and by severity. In the **Risk** view, only repositories with Advanced Security enabled appear. The reported alert counts are only for alerts discovered on the default branch for each repository.

Under the **Coverage** tab, security overview shows all repositories in your enterprise, regardless of their enablement status. For any repositories that have Advanced Security enabled, a breakdown of each tool is also included:

Dependency scanning, code scanning, and secret scanning alerts are enabled once a SARIF result file has been successfully submitted to Advanced Security. In other words, a successful scan regardless of alert discovery on any branch for a repository lights up coverage for that particular tool and repository. The enablement status doesn't consider recency of the scan. 

Hovering on a specific repository and selecting the cog icon directs you to that repository's settings pane where you can enable Advanced Security. For more information about configuring Advanced Security features, see [Configure GitHub Advanced Security](configure-github-advanced-security-features.md).
