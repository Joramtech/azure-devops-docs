# Start using Azure Repos

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Azure Repos offers free unlimited private Git repositories, making it easy to try. Git is the most commonly used version control system today and is quickly becoming the standard for version control. It is a distributed version control system, meaning that your local copy of code is a complete version control repository. These fully functional local repositories make it easy to work offline or remotely. You can commit your work locally, and then sync your copy of the repository with the copy on the server.

To get started, see [Sign up for Azure Repos](sign-up-invite-teammates.md), [Code with Git](../../user-guide/code-with-git.md?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true), and [What is Azure Repos?](what-is-repos.md).
