## Links and link types
Links support defining relationships between work items and other objects&mdash;such as commits, branches, pull requests, and more&mdash;using different link types. For more information, see [Link work items to other objects](../../boards/backlogs/add-link.md) and [Link types reference](../../boards/queries/link-type-reference.md).
