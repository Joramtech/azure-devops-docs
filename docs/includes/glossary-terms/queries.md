## Queries 

Queries are used to find and list work items. Queries support managed searches, which are used to triage work, versus ad-hoc searches, which are used to find a specific work item. Flat-list queries also support status and trend charts. For more information, see [About managed queries](../../boards/queries/about-managed-queries.md).
