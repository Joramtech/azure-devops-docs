- **Visual Studio 2019 & 2022:** As of now, there's no specific Process Template Editor extension available. But, you can still customize process templates using other tools such as any text editor or XML editor. You can also use the Azure DevOps web portal for certain customizations, especially for inherited processes.
- **Visual Studio 2017**: [TFS Process Template Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KarthikBalasubramanianMSFT.TFSProcessTemplateEditor). You can also use this version of the Process Editor to modify the old-style work item forms. You can't use it to edit forms associated with the [new web forms](/previous-versions/azure/devops/reference/process/new-work-item-experience).   
- **Visual Studio 2015**: [TFS Power Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TFSPowerToolsTeam.MicrosoftVisualStudioTeamFoundationServer2015Power).
