## Azure Boards and GitHub integration

By connecting Azure Boards with GitHub repositories, you enable linking between GitHub commits, pull requests, branches, and issues to work items. You can use GitHub for software development while using Azure Boards to plan and track your work. To get started, see [Azure Boards-GitHub integration](../boards/github/index.md).

## Azure Pipelines and GitHub integration

You can use Azure Pipelines to automatically build, test, package, release, and deploy your GitHub repository code. To get started, see [Build GitHub repositories](../pipelines/repos/github.md). 

You can map your GitHub repositories to one or more projects in Azure DevOps.
