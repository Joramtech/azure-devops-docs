### Create a .NET project

If you don't have a .NET project to work with, create a new one on your local system.  Start by installing <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0" target="_blank"> the latest .NET 8.0 SDK </a>.

1. Open a terminal window.
1. Create a project directory and navigate to it.
1. Create a new .NET 8 webapp. 

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet new webapp -f net8.0
    ```

1. From the same terminal session, run the application locally using the [`dotnet run`](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run) command from your project directory.

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet run
    ```

1. Once the application has started, press Ctrl-C to shut it down.

### Create a git repo and connect it to GitHub

1. From the project directory, [create a local git repository and commit the application code to the main branch](../../repos/git/creatingrepo.md#create-a-local-git-repo-from-an-existing-solution).

1. [Connect your local Git repo to a GitHub repo](../../repos/git/creatingrepo.md#connect-a-local-git-repo-to-a-github-repo).
