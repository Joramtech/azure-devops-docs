# Manage security in Azure Pipelines

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Azure Pipelines security controls access to pipelines and their resources through a hierarchy of security groups and users. This system governs resources like release pipelines, task groups, agent pools, and service connections, though external to pipelines. Upon creation, pipelines and resources inherit project-level permissions from predefined security groups and users, affecting all project pipelines. 

Administrators typically have unrestricted access, contributors oversee resources, and readers have view-only permissions, with user roles determining group assignments. For more information, see [About pipeline security roles](../../organizations/security/about-security-roles.md).

## Set pipeline permissions in Azure Pipelines

Pipeline security follows a hierarchical model of user and group permissions. Project-level permissions are inherited at the object level by all pipelines in the project. You can change inherited and default user and group permissions for all pipelines at the project- and object-levels. You can't change the permissions set by the system.

The following table shows the default security groups for pipelines:

| Group | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Build Administrators | Administer build permissions and manage pipelines and builds. |
| Contributors | Manage pipelines and builds, but not build queues. This group includes all team members.|
| **Project Administrators** | Administer build permissions and manage pipelines and builds. |
| Readers | View pipeline and builds. |
| Project Collection Administrators | Administer build permissions and manage pipelines and builds. |
| Project Collection Build Administrators | Administer build permissions and manage pipelines and builds. |
| Project Collection Build Service Accounts | Manage builds. |
| Project Collection Test Service Accounts | View pipelines and builds. |

The system automatically creates the *\<project name\> Build Service (collection name)* user, a member of the *Project Collection Build Service Accounts* group. This user executes build services within the project.

Depending on the resources you use in your pipelines, your pipeline could include other built-in users. For instance, if you're using a GitHub repository for your source code, a GitHub user is included.

The following table shows default permissions for security groups:
[!INCLUDE [temp](../../organizations/security/includes/pipelines-build.md)]

For a description of pipeline permissions, see [Pipeline or Build permissions](../../organizations/security/permissions.md#pipeline-or-build-object-level).

### Set object-level pipeline permissions

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2022"

By default, object-level permissions for individual pipelines are inherited from the project-level permissions. You can override the inherited project-level permissions. 

You can set the permissions to **Allow**, **Deny**, or to **Not set** if the permission isn't inherited. If inheritance is enabled, you can change an explicitly set permission back to the inherited value.

To manage permissions for a pipeline, do the following steps:

1. From your project, select **Pipelines** .
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/pipelines-navigation-from-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Pipelines menu selection.":::

## Set deployment group security in Azure Pipelines
 
A deployment group is a pool of physical or virtual target machines that have agents installed. Deployment groups are only available with classic release pipelines. You can create deployment groups in the following circumstances:

- When dependent deployment groups are provisioned for projects from organization deployment pools 
- When a deployment group is created at the project level
- When a project shares a deployment group, dependent deployment groups are created in the recipient projects

Individual deployment groups inherit the security roles from the project-level assignments. You can override the project-level assignments for a user or group. To remove an inherited user or group, or lower the privilege level of an inherited role, you must [disable inheritance](../../organizations/security/about-permissions.md).

When a deployment group gets shared with another project, a separate deployment group, which inherits its security roles, is created in the other project. If sharing is disabled, the deployment group is removed from the other project.

The following table shows security roles for deployment groups:

| Role | Description |
|------|---------|
| **Reader** | Can only view deployment groups.   |
| **Creator** | Can create deployment groups. This role is a project-level role only.  |
| **User** | Can view and use deployment groups. |
| **Service Account** | Can view agents, create sessions, and listen for jobs. This role is a collection- or organization-level role only.  |
| **Administrator** | Can administer, manage, view, and use deployment groups.  |

The following table shows default user and group role assignments:

| Group | Role |
|-|-|
| [*project name*]\Contributors | Creator (project-level), Reader (object-level) |
| [*project name*]\Deployment Group Administrators | Administrator |
| [*project name*]\Project Administrators | Administrator |
| [*project name*]\Release Administrators | Administrator |

### Set project-level deployment group security roles

Do the following steps to set project-level security roles for all deployment groups:

1. From your project, select **Deployment groups** under **Pipelines**.
1. Select **Security**.
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-group-security-selection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of security selection for all deployment groups.":::

1. Set roles for users and groups.
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-group-project-level-security-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of security dialog for all deployment groups.":::

1. To remove a user or group, select the user or group and select **Delete** :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/delete-icon.png" border="false":::.
1. Select **Save changes** :::image type="icon" source="media/save-icon.png" border="false"::: to save your changes or **Reset changes** :::image type="icon" source="media/reset-icon.png" border="false"::: to revert unsaved changes.

Do the following steps to add project users or groups that aren't listed in the security dialog:

1. Select **Add**.
2. Enter the user or group in the search bar, then select the user or group from the search result. You can add multiple users and groups.
3. Select the **Role**.
4. Select **Add** to save the changes.

### Set object-level deployment group security roles

Do the following steps to set security roles for an individual deployment group:

1. From your project, select **Deployment groups** under **Pipelines**.
2. Select a deployment group under **Groups**.
3. Select **Security**.
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-group-single-group-security-selection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of security selection for an individual deployment group.":::

4. Set roles for users and groups. To lower the privilege level of an inherited role, disable inheritance.
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-groups-single-group-security-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of object-level deployment group security dialog.":::

5. To remove a user or group, select the user or group and select **Delete** :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/delete-icon.png" border="false":::. Inherited users and groups can't be removed unless inheritance is disabled.
6. Select **Save changes** :::image type="icon" source="media/save-icon.png" border="false"::: to save your changes or **Reset changes** :::image type="icon" source="media/reset-icon.png" border="false"::: to revert unsaved changes.

When you explicitly set a role, the inheritance for that user or group is turned off. To disable inheritance for all users and groups, turn off the **Inheritance** setting. When you re-enable inheritance, the roles for all users and groups revert to their project-level assignments.

Do the following steps to add project users or groups that aren't listed in the security dialog:

1. Select **Add**.
1. Enter the user or group in the search bar, then select the user or group from the search result. You can add multiple users and groups.
1. Select the **Role**.
1. Select **Add** to save the changes.

<a id="environment-permissions">  </a>

## Set security for environments in Azure Pipelines

Environments bundle deployment targets for YAML pipelines but aren't compatible with classic pipelines. All environments inherit, security roles, assigned at the project level to default users and groups. You can customize these settings for individual environments, including removing inherited users or groups and adjusting privilege levels, by disabling inheritance. Additionally, you can manage pipeline access for each environment.

The following table shows security roles for environments:

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]  
> | Role | Description |
> |------------------------------------|---------|
> | **Creator** | Can create environments in the project. It only applies to project-level security. Contributors are automatically assigned this role. |
> | **Reader** | Can view the environment. |
> | **User** | Can use the environment when creating or editing YAML pipelines. |
> | **Administrator** | Can administer permissions, create, manage, view and use environments. The creator of an environment is granted the administrator role for that environment.  Administrators can also open access to an environment for all pipelines in the project. |

The following table shows default user and group role assignments:

| Group | Role |
|-|-|
| [*project name*]\Contributors | Creator (project-level) Reader (object-level) |
| [*project name*]\Project Administrators | Creator |
| [*project name*]\Project Valid Users | Reader |

The individual who creates an environment is automatically given the **Administrator** role for that specific environment. This role assignment is permanent and can't be changed.

### Set project-level environment security roles

To set project-level security roles for all environments, do the following steps:

1. From your project, **Environments** under **Pipelines**. 
1. Select **More actions** :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/more-actions.png" border="false"::: and select **Security**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/environments-project-security-selection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of security selection for all environments.":::

1. Set roles for user and groups to **Administrator**, **Creator**, **User**, or **Reader**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/environments-project-security-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of project-level environments security dialog.":::

1. To remove a user or group, select the user or group and select **Delete** :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/delete-icon.png" border="false":::.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes or **Undo** to revert unsaved changes.

To add project users or groups that aren't listed in the security dialog, do the following steps:

1. Select **Add**.
1. Enter the user or group in the search bar, then select the user or group from the search result. You can add multiple users and groups.
1. Select the **Role**.
1. Select **Add** to save the changes.

### Set object-level environment security

By default, object-level security roles inherit from project-level settings. But, you can customize these settings for individual environments, including removing inherited users or groups and adjusting privilege levels, by disabling inheritance. Additionally, you can manage pipeline access for each environment.

#### Set object-level environment user and group security roles

To set user and group security roles for an environment, do the following steps:

1. From your project, select **Environments** under **Pipelines**. 
1. Select an environment.
1. Select **More actions** :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/more-actions.png" border="false"::: and select **Security**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/environments-single-environment-security-selection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of security selection for a single environment.":::

1. Set roles for user and groups to **Administrator**, **User**, or **Reader**.

   :::image type="content" source="media\environments-single-environment-user-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of object-level security dialog for environments.":::

1. To remove a user or group, select the user or group and select **Delete** :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/delete-icon.png" border="false":::. Inherited users and groups can't be removed unless inheritance is disabled.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes or **Undo** to revert unsaved changes.

Setting a role explicitly for a user or group disables their inheritance. To halt inheritance for everyone, deactivate the **Inheritance** option. Reactivating inheritance resets all users and groups to their original project-level role assignments.

To add project users or groups that aren't listed in the security dialog, do the following steps:

1. Select **Add**.
2. Enter the user or group in the search bar, then select the user or group from the search result. You can add multiple users and groups.
3. Select the **Role**.
4. Select **Add** to save the changes.

#### Set pipeline access for an environment

Pipeline permissions can be set to **Open access** to allow access to all pipelines in a project or restricted access to specific pipelines. Only **Project administrators** can set pipeline permissions to **Open access**.

To set open access to all pipeline in a project, do the following steps:

1. Select **More actions** :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/more-actions.png" border="false"::: and select **Open access**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/environments-open-access-selection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of open access for pipelines in an environment.":::

## Set library security in Azure Pipelines

The library facilitates asset sharing, like variable groups and secure files, across build and release pipelines. It employs a unified security model, allowing role assignments for asset management, creation, and usage. These roles, once set at the library level, automatically apply to all contained assets but can be individually adjusted.

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../organizations/security/includes/library-roles.md)]

The following table shows default roles:

| Group | Role |
|-|-|
| [*project name*]\Project Administrators | Administrator |
| [*project name*]\Build Administrators | Administrator |
| [*project name*]\Project Valid Users | Reader |
| [*project name*]\Contributors | Creator (project-level) Reader (object-level) |
| [*project name*]\Release Administrators | Administrator |
| *project name* Build Service (*collection or organization name*) | Reader |

For individual library assets, the creator is automatically assigned the *Administrator* role.

### Set project-level library security roles

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

To manage access for all library assets, such as [variable groups](../library/variable-groups.md) and [secure files](../library/secure-files.md), do the following steps:

1. From your project, select **Pipelines** > **Library**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/pipeline-library-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Library menu item.":::

2. Select **Security**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/pipelines-security-library.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the library Security button.":::

3. Select a user or group and change the role to **Reader**, **User**, **Creator**, or **Administrator**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/library-project-level-permissions-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the library security dialog.":::

4. To remove a user or group, select the user or group and select **Delete** :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/delete-icon.png" border="false":::. 
5. Select **Save changes** :::image type="icon" source="media/save-icon.png" border="false"::: to save your changes or **Reset changes** :::image type="icon" source="media/reset-icon.png" border="false"::: to revert unsaved changes.

To add project users or groups that aren't listed in the security dialog, do the following steps:

1. Select **Add**.
1. Enter the user or group in the search bar, then select the user or group from the search result. You can add multiple users and groups.
1. Select the **Role**.
1. Select **Add** to save the changes.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2020"

You can manage access for all library assets, such as [variable groups](../library/variable-groups.md) and [secure files](../library/secure-files.md), from the project-level library security settings.

::: moniker-end

### Set secure file security roles

Security roles for **Secure files** are inherited from the project-level library role assignments by default. You can override these assignments for an individual file. To remove an inherited user or group, or lower the privilege level of an inherited role, you must disable inheritance.

The creator of the secure file is automatically assigned the **Administrator** role for that file, which can't be changed.

To set permissions for a secure file, do the following steps:

1. From your project, select **Pipelines** > **Library**.
2. Select **Secure files**.
3. Select a file.

## Set release pipeline permissions in Azure Pipelines

Once you create a release pipeline, you can set project-level permissions for all release pipelines and object-level permissions for individual release pipelines and stages. You can also set permissions for release stages, which are a subset of permissions inherited from the object-level release pipeline permissions.

The following table shows the permission hierarchy for release pipelines:

- Project-level release pipelines permissions
- Object-level release pipeline permissions
- Object-level stage permissions

The following table shows default user and group roles:

| Group | Role |
|-|-|
| **Contributors** | All permissions except *Administer release permissions*. |
| **Project Administrators** | All permissions. |
| **Readers** | Can view pipelines and releases. |
| **Release Administrators** | All permissions.|
| **Project Collection Administrators** | All permissions.|
| **\<project name\> Build Service(\<organization/collection name\>)** | Can view pipelines and releases.|
| **Project Collection Build Server (\<organization/collection name\>)** | Can view pipelines and releases.|

### Set service connection project permissions

You can share a service connection across multiple projects. Project permissions control which projects can use the service connection. By default, service connections aren't shared with any other projects.

* Only the organization-level administrators from user permissions can share the service connection with other projects.
* The user who's sharing the service connection with a project must have at least Create service connection permission in the target project.
* The user who shares the service connection with a project becomes the project-level Administrator for that service connection. The project-level inheritance is set to on in the target project.
* The service connection name is appended with the project name and it can be renamed in the target project scope.
* Organization-level administrator can unshare a service connection from any shared project.

Access is restricted to the current project by default. To grant access to other projects in the organization or collection, select **Add projects**.

## Set agent pool security in Azure Pipelines

Agent pools are a collection of agents that you use to run build and release jobs.

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You can create agent pools with either organization scope or project scope. Organization-scoped agent pools are accessible to all existing or new projects in the organization, and by default, each organization has two agent pools: **Azure Pipelines** and **Default**. These default pools are accessible by all projects in the organization.

Project-scoped agent pools are created at the project level and are accessible only to that project.

From the organization settings, you can manage the organization-level security settings for all agent pools in the organization, and for individual agent pools. Both organization- and project-level security roles can be managed from the project settings.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2022"

You can create agent pools with either collection scope or project scope. Collection scoped agent pools are accessible to all existing or new projects in the collection, and by default, each collection has two agent pools: **Azure Pipelines** and **Default**. These default pools are accessible by all projects in the collection.

Project-scoped agent pools are created at the project level and are accessible only to that project.

From the collection settings, you can manage the collection-level security settings for all agent pools in the collection, and for individual agent pools. Both collection- and project-level security roles can be managed at the object level from the project settings.

::: moniker-end

Use predefined security roles to manage [security for agent pools](../agents/pools-queues.md#security).

The following table shows security roles for agent pools:

| Role | Purpose |
|------------------------------------|---------|
| Reader | Can view agent pools. |
| User | Can use agent pools in classic and YAML build and release pipelines. |
| Creator | Can create agent pools in the project. This role is a project-level role only.|
| Service Account | Can view agents, create sessions, and listen for jobs from the agent pool. This role is set at the organization/collection level only. |
| Administrator | Can manage and use agent pools and manage roles for other users and groups. |

The following table shows default project and object security roles for agent pools:

| Group | Role |
|-|-|
| [*project name*]\Project Administrators | Administrator |
| [*project name*]\Build Administrators | Administrator |
| [*project name*]\Project Valid Users | Reader |
| [*project name*]\Release Administrators | Administrator |
| The user who created the agent pool | Administrator |
