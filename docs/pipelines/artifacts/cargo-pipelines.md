# Publish Cargo packages with Azure Pipelines

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2022](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2022.md)]

Azure Pipelines enables developers to publish Cargo packages to Azure Artifacts feeds and public registries such as Crates.io. In this article, you will learn how to publish your Cargo packages to an Azure Artifacts feed using both YAML and Classic pipelines.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure DevOps organization and a project. Create an [organization](../../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md) or a [project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md#create-a-project) if you haven't already.

- An Azure Artifacts feed. [Create a feed](../../artifacts/concepts/feeds.md#create-a-public-feed) if you don't have one already.

## Authenticate with a feed

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then select your feed.

1. Select **Connect to feed**, and then select **Cargo** from the left pane.

1. Copy the provided snippet from the **Project setup** section and add it to your *config.toml* file in your source repository. You file should look like this:

    - Project-scoped feed:
    
        ```
        [registries]
        <FEED_NAME> = { index = "sparse+https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>/_packaging/<FEED_NAME>/Cargo/index/" }
        
        [source.crates-io]
        replace-with = "<FEED_NAME>"
        ```

    - Organization-scoped feed:
    
        ```
        [registries]
        <FEED_NAME> = { index = "sparse+https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/_packaging/<FEED_NAME>/Cargo/index/" }
        
        [source.crates-io]
        replace-with = "<FEED_NAME>"
        ```

1. Create a [Personal access token](../../organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md#create-a-pat) with **Packaging** > **Read & write** scopes to authenticate with your feed.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Pipelines**, and then select your pipeline definition.

1. Select **Edit**, and then add the following snippet to your YAML pipeline.

    ```yaml
    - task: CargoAuthenticate@0
      displayName: 'Cargo Authenticate'
      inputs:
        configFile: '.cargo/config.toml'    ## Path to the config.toml file that specifies the registries you want to work with. Select the file, not the folder e.g. "/.cargo/config.toml"
    ```

# [Classic](#tab/classic)

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Pipelines**, select your pipeline definition, and then select **Edit**.

1. Select the `+` sign to add a new task. Search for the **Cargo Authenticate** task, and then select **Add** to add it to your pipeline.

1. Select the ellipsis icon to open a new window displaying your repository contents, and then choose your *config.toml* file.

## Publish crates to a feed

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Pipelines**, and then select your pipeline definition.

1. Select **Edit**, and then add the following snippet to your YAML pipeline.

    ```yaml
    - powershell: |
       cargo publish --registry <FEED_NAME>        ## Replace the placeholder with your feed name
      env:
        SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN: $(system.accesstoken)
    ```

# [Classic](#tab/classic)

1. From your Azure DevOps project, select **Pipelines**, select your pipeline definition, and then select **Edit**.

1. Select the `+` sign to add a new task, then add the **Command line** task to your pipeline definition.

1. Give your task a name, and then paste the following command into the **Script** textbox, replacing the placeholder with your feed name:

    ```PowerShell
    cargo publish --registry <FEED_NAME>
    ```

1. Select your agent job, scroll down to **Additional options**, and make sure you check the **Allow scripts to access the OAuth token** checkbox.

## Example

The following example shows how to install Rustup on the agent, configure the PATH environment variable, build the project, authenticate with CargoAuthenticate, and publish to an Azure Artifacts feed:

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: windows-latest

steps:
- powershell: |
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://sh.rustup.rs -OutFile rustup-init.sh
   bash .\rustup-init.sh -y
   echo "##vso[task.prependpath]$env:USERPROFILE\.cargo\bin"
  displayName: Install

- task: CargoAuthenticate@0
  displayName: 'cargo Authenticate'
  inputs:
    configFile: '.cargo/config.toml'

- script: |
   cargo build --all
  displayName: Build

- powershell: |
   cargo publish --registry CargoInternalFeed
  displayName: Publish
```

# [Linux](#tab/linux)

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
- script: |
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
   echo "##vso[task.prependpath]$HOME/.cargo/bin"
  displayName: Install

- task: CargoAuthenticate@0
  displayName: 'cargo Authenticate'
  inputs:
    configFile: '.cargo/config.toml'

- script: |
   cargo build --all
  displayName: Build

- powershell: |
   cargo publish --registry CargoInternalFeed
  displayName: Publish
```

Once your pipeline run completes, your crate should be available in your feed, as shown below:
