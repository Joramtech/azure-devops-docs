# Monitor your pipelines with dashboard widgets

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

You can monitor your pipelines by adding widgets to team dashboards in Azure DevOps. Widgets give you visibility to the status of your build and release pipelines and monitor test results trends. For information about team dashboards, see [About dashboards, charts, reports, and widgets](../../report/dashboards/overview.md).

## Pipeline widgets

The pipeline widgets include:

- [Build history](../../report/dashboards/widget-catalog.md#build-history-widget): View the histogram of all the builds run for a build pipeline.
- [Deployment status](../../report/dashboards/widget-catalog.md#deployment-status-widget): View the status of the deployment status and test pass rate for a recent set of builds.
- [Release pipeline overview](../../report/dashboards/widget-catalog.md#release-definition-widget): View and track the status of a release pipeline.
- [Requirements quality](../../report/dashboards/widget-catalog.md#requirements-quality-widget): Track quality continuously from a build or release pipeline.
- [Test results trend](../../report/dashboards/widget-catalog.md#test-trend-results): View trends of test results for a build or release pipeline.
- [Test results trend (Advanced)](../../report/dashboards/analytics-widgets.md#test-results-trend-advanced): View trends of test results for multiple builds and releases in near real-time with Analytics. For more information about Analytics widgets, see [Analytics widgets](../../report/dashboards/analytics-widgets.md).
