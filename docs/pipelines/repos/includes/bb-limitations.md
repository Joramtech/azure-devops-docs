Azure Pipelines loads a maximum of 2000 branches from a repository into dropdown lists in the Azure Devops Portal, for example into the **Default branch for manual and scheduled builds** setting, or when choosing a branch when running a pipeline manually. If you don't see your desired branch in the list, type the desired branch name manually.
