# Pipeline default branch

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

This article describes how to view and edit a pipeline's default branch. A pipeline's default branch defines the pipeline version used for manual builds, scheduled builds, retention policies, and in pipeline resource triggers. By default, a pipeline's default branch is the default branch of the repository.

## View and update the default branch

To view and update the **Default branch for manual and scheduled builds** setting:

1. In your Azure DevOps project, select your pipeline from the **Pipelines** list.
1. On the pipeline page, select **Edit**.

1. Select **YAML** > **Get sources**, and view the **Default branch for manual and scheduled builds** setting.

1. To change the branch, select the **Browse** icon next to the branch name, select a different branch name, and select **Select**. Then select **Save** or **Save & queue** on the pipeline page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Pipelines loads a maximum of 2,000 branches from a repository into the **Default branch for manual and scheduled builds** selector. If you don't see your desired branch in the list, enter the desired branch name manually.
