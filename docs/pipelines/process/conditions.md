# Pipeline conditions

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

This article describes the conditions under which an Azure Pipelines stage, job, or step runs, and how to specify different conditions. For more context on stages, jobs, and steps, see [Key concepts for Azure Pipelines](../get-started/key-pipelines-concepts.md).

- By default, a job or stage runs if it doesn't depend on any other job or stage, or if all its dependencies completed and succeeded. This requirement applies not only to direct dependencies, but to their indirect dependencies, computed recursively.

- By default, a step runs if nothing in its job failed yet and the step immediately preceding it completed.

You can override or customize this behavior by forcing a stage, job, or step to run even if a previous dependency fails, or by specifying a custom condition.

> [!NOTE]
> This article discusses YAML pipeline capabilities. For Classic pipelines, you can specify some conditions under which tasks or jobs run in the **Control Options** of each task, and in the **Additional options** for a job in a release pipeline.

## Conditions under which a stage, job, or step runs

In the pipeline definition YAML, you can specify the following conditions under which a stage, job, or step runs:
[!INCLUDE [include](includes/task-run-built-in-conditions.md)]
- Custom conditions.

By default, stages, jobs, and steps run if all direct and indirect dependencies succeed. This status is the same as specifying `condition: succeeded()`. For more information, see [succeeded status function](expressions.md#succeeded).

When you specify a `condition` property for a stage, job, or step, you overwrite the default `condition: succeeded()`. Specifying your own conditions can cause your stage, job, or step to run even if the build is canceled. Make sure the conditions you write take into account the state of the parent stage or job.

The following YAML example shows the `always()` and `failed()` conditions. The step in the first job runs even if dependencies fail or the build is canceled. The second job runs only if the first job fails.

```yaml
jobs:
- job: Foo

  steps:
  - script: echo Hello!
    condition: always() # this step runs, even if the build is canceled

- job: Bar
  dependsOn: Foo
  condition: failed() # this job runs only if Foo fails
```

You can also set and use variables in conditions. The following example sets and uses an `isMain` variable to designate `main` as the `Build.SourceBranch`.

```yaml
variables:
  isMain: $[eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')]

stages:
- stage: A
  jobs:
  - job: A1
    steps:
      - script: echo Hello Stage A!

- stage: B
  condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables.isMain, true))
  jobs:
  - job: B1
    steps:
      - script: echo Hello Stage B!
      - script: echo $(isMain)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Conditions are evaluated to determine whether to start a stage, job, or step. Therefore, nothing computed at runtime inside that unit of work is available. For example, if you have a job that sets a variable using a runtime expression with `$[ ]` syntax, you can't use that variable in a custom condition in that job.

## Custom conditions

If the built-in conditions don't meet your needs, you can specify *custom conditions*. You write conditions as expressions in YAML pipeline definitions.

The agent evaluates the expression beginning with the innermost function and proceeding outward. The final result is a boolean value that determines whether or not the task, job, or stage should run. For a full guide to the syntax, see [Expressions](expressions.md).

If any of your conditions make it possible for the task to run even after the build is canceled, specify a reasonable value for [cancel timeout](phases.md#timeouts) so that these tasks have enough time to complete after the user cancels a run.

## Condition outcomes when a build is canceled

Canceling a build doesn't mean that all its stages, jobs, or steps stop running. Which stages, jobs, or steps stop running depend on the conditions you specified, and at what point of the pipeline's execution you canceled the build. If a stage, job, or step's parent is skipped, the task doesn't run, regardless of its conditions.

A stage, job, or step runs whenever its conditions evaluate to `true`. If your condition doesn't take into account the state of the task's parent, the task might run even if its parent is canceled. To control whether stages, jobs, or steps with conditions run when a build is canceled, make sure to include a [job status check function](expressions.md?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true#job-status-functions) in your conditions.

The following examples show the outcomes of various conditions set on stages, jobs, or steps when the build is canceled.

### Stage example 1

In the following pipeline, by default `stage2` would depend on `stage1`, but `stage2` has a `condition` set to run whenever the source branch is `main`, regardless of `stage1` status.

If you queue a build on the `main` branch and cancel it while `stage1` is running, `stage2` still runs, because `eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')` evaluates to `true`.

```yaml
stages:
- stage: stage1
  jobs:
  - job: A
    steps:
      - script: echo 1; sleep 30
- stage: stage2
  condition: eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')
  jobs:
  - job: B
    steps:
      - script: echo 2
```

### Stage example 2

In the following pipeline, `stage2` depends on `stage1` by default. Job `B` in `stage2` has a `condition` set. If you queue a build on the `main` branch and cancel it while `stage1` is running, `stage2` doesn't run, even though it contains a job whose condition evaluates to `true`.

The reason is because `stage2` has the default `condition: succeeded()`, which evaluates to `false` when `stage1` is canceled. Therefore, `stage2` is skipped, and none of its jobs run.

```yaml
stages:
- stage: stage1
  jobs:
  - job: A
    steps:
      - script: echo 1; sleep 30
- stage: stage2
  jobs:
  - job: B
    condition: eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')
    steps:
      - script: echo 2
```

### Stage example 3

In the following pipeline, by default `stage2` depends on `stage1`, and the step inside job `B` has a `condition` set.

If you queue a build on the `main` branch and cancel it while `stage1` is running, `stage2` doesn't run, even though it contains a step in job `B` whose condition evaluates to `true`. The reason is because `stage2` is skipped in response to `stage1` being canceled.

```yaml
stages:
- stage: stage1
  jobs:
  - job: A
    steps:
      - script: echo 1; sleep 30
- stage: stage2
  jobs:
  - job: B
    steps:
      - script: echo 2
        condition: eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')
```

### Job example 1

In the following YAML pipeline, job `B` depends on job `A` by default, but job `B` has a `condition` set to run whenever the source branch is `main`. If you queue a build on the `main` branch and cancel it while job `A` is running, job `B` still runs, because `eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')` evaluates to `true`.

```yaml
jobs:
- job: A
  steps:
  - script: sleep 30
- job: B
  dependsOn: A 
  condition: eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')
  steps:
    - script: echo step 2.1
```

If you want job `B` to run only when job `A` succeeds and the build source is the `main` branch, your `condition` should be `and(succeeded(), eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main'))`.

### Job example 2

In the following pipeline, job `B` depends on job `A` by default. If you queue a build on the `main` branch and cancel it while job `A` is running, job `B` doesn't run, even though its step has a `condition` that evaluates to `true`.

The reason is because job `B` has the default `condition: succeeded()`, which evaluates to `false` when job `A` is canceled. Therefore, job `B` is skipped, and none of its steps run.

```yaml
jobs:
- job: A
  steps:
  - script: sleep 30
- job: B
  dependsOn: A 
  steps:
    - script: echo step 2.1
      condition: eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main', succeeded())
      
```

### Step example

You can also have conditions on steps.

In the following pipeline, step 2.3 has a `condition` set to run whenever the source branch is `main`. If you queue a build on the `main` branch and cancel it while steps 2.1 or 2.2 are running, step 2.3 still runs, because `eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')` evaluates to `true`.

```yaml
steps:
  - script: echo step 2.1
  - script: echo step 2.2; sleep 30
  - script: echo step 2.3
    condition: eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')
```

## Condition settings

The following table shows example `condition` settings to produce various outcomes.

> [!NOTE]
> `Release.Artifacts.{artifact-alias}.SourceBranch` is equivalent to `Build.SourceBranch`.

| Desired outcome | Example condition setting |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| Run if the source branch is main, even if the parent or preceding stage, job, or step failed or was canceled. | `eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')` |
| Run if the source branch is main and the parent or preceding stage, job, or step succeeded. | `and(succeeded(), eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main'))` |
| Run if the source branch isn't main, and the parent or preceding stage, job, or step succeeded. | `and(succeeded(), ne(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main'))` |
| Run for user topic branches, if the parent or preceding stage, job, or step succeeded. | `and(succeeded(), startsWith(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/users/'))` |
| Run for continuous integration (CI) builds, if the parent or preceding stage, job, or step succeeded. | `and(succeeded(), in(variables['Build.Reason'], 'IndividualCI', 'BatchedCI'))` |
| Run if the build was triggered by a branch policy for a pull request, and the parent or preceding stage, job, or step failed. | `and(failed(), eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest'))` |
| Run for a scheduled build, even if the parent or preceding stage, job, or step failed or was canceled. | `eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'Schedule')` |
| Run if a variable is set to true, even if the parent or preceding stage, job, or step failed or was canceled. | `eq(variables['System.debug'], true)` |

> [!NOTE]
> You can set a condition to run if a variable is null (empty string). Since all variables are treated as strings in Azure Pipelines, an empty string is equivalent to `null` in the following pipeline:
> 
> ```yaml
> variables:
> - name: testEmpty
>   value: ''
> 
> jobs:
>   - job: A
>     steps:
>     - script: echo testEmpty is blank
>     condition: eq(variables.testEmpty, '')
> ```

### Parameters in conditions

Parameter expansion happens before conditions are considered. Therefore, when you declare a parameter in the same pipeline as a condition, you can embed the parameter inside the condition. The script in the following YAML runs because `parameters.doThing` is true.

```yaml
parameters:
- name: doThing
  default: true
  type: boolean

steps:
- script: echo I did a thing
  condition: and(succeeded(), ${{ eq(parameters.doThing, true) }})
```

The `condition` in the preceding pipeline combines two functions: `succeeded()` and `${{ eq(parameters.doThing, true) }}`. The `succeeded()` function checks if the previous step succeeded. The `succeeded()` function returns `true` because there was no previous step.

The `${{ eq(parameters.doThing, true) }}` function checks whether the `doThing` parameter is equal to `true`. Since the default value for `doThing` is `true`, the condition returns `true` by default unless the pipeline sets a different value.

### Template parameters in conditions

When you pass a parameter to a template, you need to either set the parameter's value in your template or [use templateContext to pass the parameter to the template](template-parameters.md?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true#use-templatecontext-to-pass-properties-to-templates).

For example, the following *parameters.yml* file declares the `doThing` parameter and default value:

```yaml
# parameters.yml
parameters:
- name: doThing
  default: true # value passed to the condition
  type: boolean

jobs:
  - job: B
    steps:
    - script: echo I did a thing
    condition: ${{ eq(parameters.doThing, true) }}
```

The pipeline code references the *parameters.yml* template. The output of the pipeline is `I did a thing` because the parameter `doThing` is true.

```yaml
# azure-pipeline.yml
parameters:
- name: doThing
  default: true 
  type: boolean

trigger:
- none

extends:
  template: parameters.yml
```

For more template parameter examples, see the [Template usage reference](templates.md).

### Job output variables used in subsequent job conditions

You can make a variable available to future jobs and specify it in a condition. Variables available to future jobs must be marked as [multi-job output variables](./variables.md#set-a-multi-job-output-variable) by using `isOutput=true`, as in the following code:

```yaml
jobs:
- job: Foo
  steps:
  - bash: |
      echo "This is job Foo."
      echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=doThing;isOutput=true]Yes" #set variable doThing to Yes
    name: DetermineResult
- job: Bar
  dependsOn: Foo
  condition: eq(dependencies.Foo.outputs['DetermineResult.doThing'], 'Yes') #map doThing and check the value
  steps:
  - script: echo "Job Foo ran and doThing is Yes."
```

### Variables created in a step used in subsequent step conditions

You can create a variable that's available for future steps to specify in a condition. Variables created from steps are available to future steps by default and don't need to be marked as [multi-job output variables](./variables.md#set-a-multi-job-output-variable).

There are some important things to note about [scoping](./variables.md#set-a-job-scoped-variable-from-a-script) variables that are created from steps.

- Variables created in a step in a job are scoped to the steps in the same job.
- Variables created in a step are available in subsequent steps only as environment variables.
- Variables created in a step can't be used in the step that defines them.

The following example shows creating a pipeline variable in a step and using the variable in a subsequent step's condition and script.

```yaml
steps:

# This step creates a new pipeline variable: doThing. This variable is available to subsequent steps.
- bash: |
    echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=doThing]Yes"
  displayName: Step 1

# This step is able to use doThing, so it uses doThing in its condition
- script: |
    # Access the variable from Step 1 as an environment variable.
    echo "Value of doThing (as DOTHING env var): $DOTHING."
  displayName: Step 2
  condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables['doThing'], 'Yes')) # or and(succeeded(), eq(variables.doThing, 'Yes'))
```

## FAQ

<!-- BEGINSECTION class="md-qanda" -->

### How can I trigger a job if a previous job succeeded with issues? 

You can use the result of the previous job in a condition. For example, in the following YAML, the condition `eq(dependencies.A.result,'SucceededWithIssues')` allows job `B` to run because job `A` succeeded with issues. 

```yaml
jobs:
- job: A
  displayName: Job A
  continueOnError: true # next job starts even if this one fails
  steps:
  - script: echo Job A ran
  - script: exit 1

- job: B
  dependsOn: A
  condition: eq(dependencies.A.result,'SucceededWithIssues') # targets the result of the previous job 
  displayName: Job B
  steps:
  - script: echo Job B ran
```

### I canceled my build, but it's still running. Why?

You can experience this issue if a condition configured in a stage doesn't include a [job status check function](expressions.md?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true#job-status-functions). To resolve the issue, add a job status check function to the condition.

If you cancel a job while it's in the queue stage but not running, the entire job is canceled, including all the other stages. For more information, see [Condition outcomes when a build is canceled](#condition-outcomes-when-a-build-is-canceled) earlier in this article.
