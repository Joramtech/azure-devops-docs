# Use variables in Classic release pipelines

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Using variables in Classic release pipelines is a convenient way to exchange and transport data throughout your pipeline. Each variable is stored as a string and its value can change between pipeline runs.

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

Unlike [Runtime parameters](../process/runtime-parameters.md), which are only available at template parsing time, variables in Classic release pipelines are accessible throughout the entire deployment process

::: moniker-end

When setting up tasks to deploy your application in each stage of your Classic release pipeline, variables can help you:

- **Simplify customization**: Define a generic deployment pipeline once and easily adapt it for different stages. For instance, use a variable to represent a web deployment's connection string, adjusting its value as needed for each stage. These are known as *custom variables*.

- **Leverage contextual information**: Access details about the release context, such as a [stage](../process/stages.md), an [artifact](artifacts.md), or the [agent](../agents/agents.md) running the deployment. For example, your scripts might require the build location for download, or the agent's working directory to create temporary files. These are referred to as *default variables*.

> [!NOTE] 
> For YAML pipelines, see [user-defined variables](../process/variables.md) and [predefined variables](../build/variables.md) for more details.

## Default variables

Default variables provide essential information about the execution context to your running tasks and scripts. These variables allow you to access details about the *system*, *release*, *stage*, or *agent* in which they are running.

With the exception of *System.Debug*, default variables are read-only, with their values automatically set by the system.

Some of the most significant variables are described in the following tables. To view the full list, see [View the current values of all variables](#view-the-current-values-of-all-variables).

### System variables

| Variable name                   | Description                                                                                                                                                       |

## Release Artifacts variables

For each artifact that is referenced in a release, you can use the following artifact variables. Note that not all variables apply to every artifact type. The table below lists default artifact variables and provides examples of their values based on the artifact type. If an example is empty, it indicates that the variable is not applicable for that artifact type.

Replace the `{alias}` placeholder with the value you specified for the [artifact source alias](artifacts.md#artifact-source-alias) or with the default value generated for the release pipeline.

| Variable name | Description |

## Primary Artifact variables

In Classic release pipelines, if you are using multiple artifacts, you can designate one as the primary artifact. Azure Pipelines will then populate the following variables for the designated primary artifact.

| Variable name                    | Same as                                              |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Build.DefinitionId**           | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.DefinitionId |
| **Build.DefinitionName**         | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.DefinitionName |
| **Build.BuildNumber**            | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.BuildNumber |
| **Build.BuildId**                | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.BuildId |
| **Build.BuildURI**               | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.BuildURI |
| **Build.SourceBranch**           | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.SourceBranch |
| **Build.SourceBranchName**       | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.SourceBranchName |
| **Build.SourceVersion**          | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.SourceVersion |
| **Build.Repository.Provider**    | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.Repository.Provider |
| **Build.RequestedForID**         | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.RequestedForID |
| **Build.RequestedFor**           | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.RequestedFor |
| **Build.Type**                   | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.Type |
| **Build.PullRequest.TargetBranch** | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.PullRequest.TargetBranch |
| **Build.PullRequest.TargetBranchName** | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.PullRequest.TargetBranchName |

## Use default variables

You can use the default variables in two ways: as parameters to tasks in a release pipeline or within your scripts.

You can use a default variable directly as an input to a task. For example, to pass `Release.Artifacts.{Artifact alias}.DefinitionName` as an argument to a PowerShell task for an artifact with *ASPNET4.CI* as its alias, you would use `$(Release.Artifacts.ASPNET4.CI.DefinitionName)`.

:::image type="content"  source="media/variables-01.png" alt-text="A screenshot displaying how to use a default variable as an argument.":::   

To use a default variable in your script, you must first replace the `.` in the default variable names with `_`. For example, to print the value of `Release.Artifacts.{Artifact alias}.DefinitionName` for an artifact with *ASPNET4.CI* as its alias in a PowerShell script, use `$env:RELEASE_ARTIFACTS_ASPNET4_CI_DEFINITIONNAME`. Note that the original alias, *ASPNET4.CI*, is replaced with *ASPNET4_CI*.

## Custom variables

Custom variables can be defined at various scopes.

- **Variable Groups**: Use variable groups to share values across all definitions in a project. This is useful when you want to use the same values throughout definitions, stages, and tasks within a project, and manage them from a single location. Define and manage variable groups in the **Pipelines** > **Library**.

- **Release Pipeline Variables**: Use release pipeline variables to share values across all stages within a release pipeline. This is ideal for scenarios where you need a consistent value across stages and tasks, with the ability to update it from a single location. Define and manage these variables in the **Variables** tab of the release pipeline. In the Pipeline Variables page, set the **Scope** drop-down list to *Release* when adding a variable.

- **Stage Variables**: Use stage variables to share values within a specific stage of a release pipeline. This is useful for values that differ from stage to stage but are consistent across all tasks within a stage. Define and manage these variables in the **Variables** tab of the release pipeline. In the Pipeline Variables page, set the **Scope** drop-down list to appropriate environment when adding a variable.
  
Using custom variables at the project, release pipeline, and stage levels helps you to:

- Avoid duplicating values, making it easier to update all occurrences with a single change.

- Secure sensitive values by preventing them from being viewed or modified by users. To mark a variable as secure (secret), select the ![padlock](media/padlock-icon.png) icon next to the variable.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The values of the hidden variables (secret) are securely stored on the server and cannot be viewed by users after they are saved. During deployment, Azure Pipelines decrypts these values when referenced by tasks and passes them to the agent over a secure HTTPS channel.

> [!NOTE]
> Creating custom variables can overwrite standard variables. For example, if you define a custom **Path** variable on a Windows agent, it will overwrite the *$env:Path* variable, which may prevent PowerShell from running properly.

## Use custom variables

To use custom variables in your tasks, enclose the variable name in parentheses and precede it with a **$** character. For example, if you have a variable named *adminUserName*, you can insert its current value into a task as `$(adminUserName)`.

> Variables from different groups linked to a pipeline at the same scope (e.g., job or stage) may conflict, leading to unpredictable results. To avoid this, ensure that variables across all your variable groups have unique names.

## Run a release in debug mode

Running a release in debug mode can help you diagnose and resolve issues or failures by displaying additional information during the release execution. You can enable debug mode for the entire release or just for the tasks within a specific release stage.

- To enable debug mode for an entire release, add a variable named `System.Debug` with the value `true` to the **Variables** tab of the release pipeline.

- To enable debug mode for a specific stage, open the **Configure stage** dialog from the shortcut menu of the stage, and add a variable named `System.Debug` with the value `true` to the **Variables** tab.

- Alternatively, create a [variable group](../library/variable-groups.md) containing a variable named `System.Debug` with the value `true`, and link this variable group to the release pipeline.
