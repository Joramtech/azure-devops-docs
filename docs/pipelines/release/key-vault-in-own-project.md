# Use Azure Key Vault secrets in your Pipeline

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

With Azure Key Vault, you can securely store and manage your sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, certificates, etc. using Azure Key Vault, you can easily create and manage encryption keys to encrypt your data. Azure Key Vault can also be used to manage certificates for all your resources. In this article, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Create an Azure Key Vault.
> - Configure your Key Vault permissions.
> - Create a new service connection.
> - Query for secrets from your Azure Pipeline.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure DevOps organization. [Create one for free](../../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md#create-an-organization) if you don't already have one.
- Your own project. [Create a project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md#create-a-project) if you don't already have one.
- Your own repository. [Create a new Git repo](../../repos/git/create-new-repo.md) if you don't already have one.
- An Azure subscription. [Create a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) if you don't already have one.

## Create a Key Vault

### [Azure portal](#tab/portal/)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and then select **Create a resource**.

1. Under **Key Vault**, select **Create** to create a new Azure Key Vault.

1. Select your **Subscription** from the dropdown menu, and then select an existing **Resource group** or create a new one. Enter a **Key vault name**, select a **Region**, choose a **Pricing tier**, and select **Next** if you want to configure additional properties. Otherwise, select **Review + create** to keep the default settings.

1. Once the deployment is complete, select **Go to resource**.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/cli/)

1. First, set your default region and Azure subscription:

    - Set default subscription:
    
    ```azurecli
    az account set --subscription <your_subscription_name_or_subscription_ID>
    ```

    - Set default region:
    
    ```azurecli
    az config set defaults.location=<your_region>
    ```

1. Create a new resource group to host your Azure Key Vault. A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution:

    ```azurecli
    az group create --name <your-resource-group>
    ```
   
1. Create a new Azure Key Vault:

    ```azurecli
    az keyvault create \
      --name <your-key-vault-name> \
      --resource-group <your-resource-group>
    ```

# [Service Principal](#tab/serviceprincipal)

## Create a service principal

In this step, we will create a new [service principal](/cli/azure/azure-cli-sp-tutorial-1) in Azure, enabling us to query our Azure Key Vault from Azure Pipelines.

1. Navigate to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), then select the **>_** icon from the menu bar to open the **Cloud Shell**.

1. Select **PowerShell** or leave it as **Bash** based on your preference.

1. Run the following command to create a new service principal:

    ```Azure CLI
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name YOUR_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME
    ```

1. Your output should match the example below. Be sure to copy the output of your command, as you will need it to create the service connection in the upcoming step. 

    ```json
    {
      "appId": "00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444",
      "displayName": "MyServicePrincipal",
      "password": "***********************************",
      "tenant": "aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee"
    }
    ```

## Create a service connection

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Project settings**, and then select **Service connections**.

1. Select **New service connection**, select **Azure Resource Manager**, and then select **Next**.

1. Select **Service principal (manual)**, and then select **Next**.

1. For **Identity Type**, select **App registration or managed identity (manual)** from the dropdown menu.

1. For *Credential**, select **Workload identity federation**.

1. Provide a name for your service connection, and then select **Next**.

1. Copy the **Issuer** and the **Subject identifier** as we will need it in the next step.

1. Select **Azure Cloud** for **Environment**, and **Subscription** for the **Subscription scope**.

1. Enter your Azure **Subscription ID** and **Subscription name**.

1. For **Authentication**, paste your service principal's **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**

1. Under **Security**, select the **Grant access permission to all pipelines** checkbox to allow all pipelines to use this service connection. If you don't select this option, you must manually grant access to each pipeline that uses this service connection.

1. Leave this open, you'll return to verify and save once you've (1) created the federated credential in Azure and (2) granted your service principal Read access at the subscription level.

## Create a federated credential in Azure

1. Navigate to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), then enter your service principal's *ClientID* in the search bar, and then select your *Application*.

1. Under **Manage**, select **Certificates & secrets** > **Federated credentials**.

1. Select **Add credential**, and then for **Federated credential scenario**, select **Other issuer**.

1. For **Issuer**, paste the *Issuer* you copied from your service connection earlier.

1. For **Subject identifier**, paste the *Subject identifier* you copied from your service connection earlier.

1. Provide a **Name** for your federated credential, and then select **Add** when you're done.

## Add role assignment to your subscription

Before you can verify the connection, you need to grant the service principal **Read** access at the subscription level:

1. Navigate to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

1. Under **Azure service**, select **Subscriptions**, and then find and select your subscription.

1. Select **Access control (IAM)**, and then select **Add** > **Add role assignment**.

1. Select **Reader** under the **Role** tab, and then select **Next**.

1. Select **User, group, or service principal**, and then select **Select members**. 

1. In the search bar, paste your service principal's *Object ID*, select it, then click on the **Select** button.
 
1. Select **Review + assign**, review your settings, and then select **Review + assign** once more to confirm your choices and add the role assignment.

1. Once the role assignment is added. go back to your service connection (in Azure DevOps) to finally select **Verify and Save** to save your service connection.

## Configure Key Vault access policies

1. Navigate to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), find the key vault you created earlier, and then select **Access policies**.

1. Select **Create**, and then under **Secret permissions** add the **Get** and **List** permissions, and then select **Next**.

1. Under **Principal**, paste your service principal's *Object ID*, select it and then select **Next**.

1. Select **Next** once more, review your settings, and then select **Save** when you're done.

## Query and use secrets in your pipeline

Using the [Azure Key Vault task](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-key-vault-v2) we can fetch the value of our secret and use it in subsequent tasks in our pipeline. One thing to keep in mind is that secrets must be explicitly mapped to env variable as shown in the example below.

```YAML
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- task: AzureKeyVault@1
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: 'SERVICE_CONNECTION_NAME'
    KeyVaultName: 'KEY_VAULT_NAME'
    SecretsFilter: '*'

- bash: |
    echo "Secret Found! $MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR"        
  env:
    MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR: $(SECRET_NAME)
```

The output from the last bash command should look like this:

```
Secret Found! ***
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to query for multiple secrets from your Azure Key Vault, use the `SecretsFilter` argument to pass a comma-separated list of secret names: *'secret1, secret2'*.
