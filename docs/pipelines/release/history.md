# View Classic pipeline history

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

With Azure Pipelines, you can set up a classic pipeline to build your project. This article will guide you through checking the history of your classic pipeline to see what changed, when it happened, and who made the changes.

## Prerequisites

- Create an Azure DevOps [organization](../../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md) and a [project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md#create-a-project) if you haven't already.

- A working Classic pipeline.
