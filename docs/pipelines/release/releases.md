# Create Classic releases

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Azure Pipelines offers developers a structured framework for deploying applications across multiple environments efficiently and securely using classic release pipelines. In this article you learn how to create release definitions in Azure Pipelines.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure DevOps organization. [Create one for free](../../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md).

- An Azure DevOps project. Create a new [project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md#create-a-project) if you don't have one already.

## Create a release definition

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Pipelines** > **Releases**.

1. If this your first release pipeline, select **New pipeline**, otherwise select **New** > **New release pipeline**.

1. Select a template, or start with an **Empty job**.

1. Under **Artifacts**, select **Add an artifact**, select your **Source type**, and then fill out the required fields. Select **Add** when you're done.

1. Under **Stages**, select the job/task link, and add the tasks you need for your scenario to the **Agent job**.

1. Select **Save** when you're done, add a comment (optional), and then select **Ok**.
