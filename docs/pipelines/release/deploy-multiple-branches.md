# Deploy to different stages from multiple branches using Classic release pipelines

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

Classic release pipelines provide a convenient graphical user interface for setting up a continuous delivery solution for your application. Classic releases can be configured to trigger deployments automatically whenever a new artifact is available. Artifact filters can be used with release triggers to deploy from multiple branches. By applying artifact filters to specific branches, you can control deployment to particular stages based on your needs.

In this article, you'll learn how to:

> * Deploy to multiple stages.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure DevOps organization and a project. Create an [organization](../../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md) or a [project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md#create-a-project) if you haven't already.

- A working pipeline set up for your repository to build your project and generate a pipeline artifact. [Create your first pipeline](../create-first-pipeline.md) if you don't have one already.

## Create a release pipeline

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Pipelines** > **Releases**. If this is your first release pipeline, select **New Pipeline**, otherwise select **New** > **New release pipeline**.

1. When prompted to select a template, select **Start with an empty job**.

1. Under **Stages**, select the stage and rename it to **Dev**. The following steps show how to configure this stage to be triggered when an artifact is published from the *Dev* branch.

1. Under **Artifacts**, select **Add** to add an artifact. Specify your **Source type** and fill out the required fields (these vary based on the selected source type). Select **Add** when you're done.

    :::image type="content" source="media/add-artifact.png" alt-text="A screenshot that shows how to add an artifact to a Classic release pipeline.":::

1. Select the **Continuous deployment trigger** icon, and then enable the **Continuous deployment trigger** to create a release whenever a new artifact is available.

1. In the Dev stage, select the **Pre-deployment conditions** icon and set the deployment trigger to **After release**. This will trigger a deployment to this stage whenever a new release is created.

1. while still in **Pre-deployment conditions**, enable **Artifact filters**, select **Add**, and then specify the artifact you selected earlier and set the **Build branch** to *Dev*.

## Add a new stage

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Pipelines** > **Releases**, select your release pipeline, and then select **Edit**.

1. Under **Stages**, select **Add** > **New stage** to add a new stage.
 
1. Select **Start with an empty job** when prompted to select a template. 

1. Select your new stage and rename it to **Prod**. The following steps show how to configure this stage to trigger when an artifact is published from the *main* branch.

1. Select your *Prod* stage, select the **Pre-deployment conditions** icon, and set the deployment trigger to **After release**. This ensures deployment to this stage whenever a new release is created.

1. Select the toggle button to enable **Artifact filters**. Select **Add**, and then specify the artifact you selected earlier and set the **Build branch** to *main*.

## Deploy to a specific stage

Now that you've set up your stages, every time a new artifact is available, the release pipeline will detect which branch triggered the build and deploy only to the appropriate stage.
