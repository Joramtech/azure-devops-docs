# New security overview alert details and reporting capabilities

To better empower application security teams and security champions, weâ€™re adding new columns into the security overview risk page and filtering options to give you more insight into the security posture of your repositories. These include new, dismissed, and fixed alerts as well as filtering options by repository, toolset, and a time-bound.
