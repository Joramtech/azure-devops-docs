# Advanced Security alert events added to Azure DevOps service hooks framework

A few alert-oriented events will be integrated with Azure DevOps service hooks, enabling you to customize notifications and create integrations with external platforms. Just like other events, youâ€™ll be able to filter by repository and branch, as well as alert type and severity for Advanced Security.
