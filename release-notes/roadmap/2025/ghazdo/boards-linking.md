# Link Boards items to Advanced Security Alerts

To assist in the remediation experience for Advanced Security findings, weâ€™re introducing the ability to link an existing work item to alerts. These links will be bi-directional, so you can create the relationship from a work item or Advanced Security alert. You can link multiple alerts per work item or multiple work items per alert.

This will allow customers to retain their existing work management and tracking capabilities in boards, while providing visibility into any security impact to all Boards users and stakeholders.
