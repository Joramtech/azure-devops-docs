# Adding additional metadata for dependency alerts to improve remediation

Any additional pieces of information about an alert can help you better triage and understand the priority of an alert, especially if you have multiple alerts of the same severity. Weâ€™ll be introducing detection of development dependencies for select supported ecosystems as well as surfacing information about the EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) score for dependency alerts.
