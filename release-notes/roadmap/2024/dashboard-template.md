# Dashboard Template

To tackle the challenge of time-consuming dashboard setup, Azure DevOps now offers Dashboard Templates. This feature enables users to bypass the blank slate and jumpstart their dashboard creation using a selection of pre-designed widget templates, or to create a custom template to reuse. It streamlines the dashboard creation process, offering a time-saving solution without compromising the option for customization. Users can swiftly construct a dashboard that meets their specific needs or opt for the original empty dashboard to start from the ground up. With Dashboard Templates, users of all skill levels can more efficiently realize a functional and tailored dashboard experience.
