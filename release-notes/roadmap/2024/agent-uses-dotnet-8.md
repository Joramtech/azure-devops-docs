# Pipeline Agent uses .NET 8

As .NET 6 reaches its end-of-life in November 2024, we will upgrade the pipeline agent to run on .NET 8. This update will be seamless to most customers. However, it will impact you if you are running the agent on an older operating system that is no longer supported by .NET 6.
