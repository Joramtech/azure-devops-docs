# Automatically link pull requests

When linking a work item to a GitHub branch, I want all pull requests on that branch to automatically link to the same work item. This would streamline the process of tracking development efforts, ensuring that all related pull requests are consistently associated with the correct work item. It would also reduce manual effort and minimize the risk of missing links between work items and pull requests, improving traceability and collaboration.
