# Private Dashboard

Private Dashboards in Azure DevOps introduce a tailored level of confidentiality for your dashboard. Unlike the current project and team-level dashboards, which are publicly visible, Private Dashboards offer controlled access, visible only to a select group of individuals. Unlinked to any team, these dashboards provide a secure space for users to create and manage data without broader visibility. With Private Dashboards, you can build more customized dashboards incorporating private queries and share your dashboards with a select group, ensuring the privacy and exclusivity of your data.
