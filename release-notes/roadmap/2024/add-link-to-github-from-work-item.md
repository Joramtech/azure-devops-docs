# Add link to GitHub Commit or Pull Request from work item

Improve the experience of adding a link to a GitHub commit or pull request from a work item. The new experience will allow you to search for the commit or pull request and select it from a list of repositories. This will make it easier to link to the correct commit or pull request.

Example:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![screen shot example adding link to Github](media\add-link-to-github.png)

> [!NOTE]
> This feature will only be available with the [**New Boards Hubs** preview](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/new-boards-hub-public-preview/).
