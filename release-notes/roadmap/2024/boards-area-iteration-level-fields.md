# Enable area and iteration level fields

Area and iteration level fields have long been a valuable part of the product, allowing users to query or display results based on the specific levels at which they are defined:

(Root) Level 1 / Level 2 / Level 3 / etc.

Historically these fields have only been available on a few select organizations. Lets change that by enabling the Area level and Iteration level fields for all organizations.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature will only be available in the New Boards Hub preview.
