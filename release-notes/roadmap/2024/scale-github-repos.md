# Improve scalability 

1. Today, you can only link up to 500 GitHub repositories to a single Azure DevOps project. We want to improve the user experience to scale up and allow more than 500 repositories to be connected.

2. Improve the experience to prevent page timeouts when searching for GitHub repositories to link to your Azure DevOps project.
