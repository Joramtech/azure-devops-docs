# Reduce time to filter test plans and test suites in copy and import operations

Copy and import operations in Azure Test Plans require an entire list of test plans and test suites to load first into the browser. This can become time consuming for organizations with large volume of test plans and test suites. Hence, weâ€™re introducing an additional search capability where you can directly enter the Test Plan ID or Suite ID and quickly search for their relevant test plan or test suite.
