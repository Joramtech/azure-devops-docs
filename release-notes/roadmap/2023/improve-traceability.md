# Improve traceability of in-progress test executions

Manual testers often start working on a test case but cannot immediately mark it as pass, fail etc. They might need to do offline consultations before arriving at the outcome. Hence, sometime there is a delay between starting the work on a test-point vs completing the test run. Weâ€™re improving the experience to capture these transient in-progress test executions better.
