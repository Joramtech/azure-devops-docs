# Export Test Plan in XLSX format

Customers of Azure Test plans need to export data for a wide variety of use-cases. Currently, users can only export Test plan data (with all nested suites and latest test outcome) into PDF and HTML formats. Weâ€™re improving our export capability by adding support for Microsoft Excel supported format (i.e. XLSX) as well.  

This will allow customers to easily edit/modify the exported data as per their needs.
