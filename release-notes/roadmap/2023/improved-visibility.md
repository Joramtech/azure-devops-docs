# New Test Runs experience

We're are redesigning the Test Runs experience to let users work with test runs and test results in a much simpler way. The new design will also make it easier to understand the co-relation between test results and the version of a test case definition used to execute that particular run. Test Runs is an important part of Azure Test Plans product and these improvements will address long-standing user needs around post execution analysis.
