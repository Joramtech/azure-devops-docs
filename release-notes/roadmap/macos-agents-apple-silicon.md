# Hosted macOS agents on Apple Silicon

Customers have been waiting for Apple Silicon (Arm64) support on Microsoft-hosted macOS agents in Azure Pipelines. We can't support this, or provide larger SKUs of macOS agents, because our current uniform billing model across Linux, Windows, and macOS-hosted agents is unable to support them. We are working on a solution.
