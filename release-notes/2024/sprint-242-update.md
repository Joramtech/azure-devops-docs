# Enhanced GitHub integration and Azure Pipelines security

With this update, we have two new GitHub integration improvements to share. First, you can now create a new GitHub branch directly from a work item. Secondly, we have improved the connection experience to GitHub Repositories, reducing the risk of timeout errors and long wait times for customers with thousands of repositories.

In addition, weâ€™re excited to announce that in Azure Pipelines, you can enhance pipeline security by making any YAML stage unskippable using a new property setting.

Check out the release notes for details.
