### Support for Rust Crates is generally available

Beginning February 16, 2024, Rust Crates support will become a generally available feature for Azure Artifacts. Billing meters will be activated, using the same pricing model that applies to the other supported protocols.

### Azure Artifacts support for npm audit 

Azure Artifacts now supports `npm audit` and `npm audit fix` commands. This feature enables users to analyze and fix their project's vulnerabilities by automatically updating insecure package versions.
