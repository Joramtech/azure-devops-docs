### Select a geography when creating a new Azure DevOps organization

When creating a new organization in Azure DevOps, you can now  select a geography, instead of a region. By default, the system selects your nearest geography, but you can opt for a different one based on your team's location or due to specific data sovereignty requirements. You can view your geography in the overview section of organization settings.

For more information, see [Find or change your organization geography](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/change-organization-location?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true).

### Removed Visual Studio Subscriber option from group rules

Visual Studio subscriptions that a user has assigned to them have always taken precedence over group rules when the user logs in. To avoid confusion we removed the Visual Studio Subscriber option from group rules. To learn more visit, [How do Visual Studio Subscriptions work with group rules ?](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/assign-access-levels-by-group-membership#q-how-do-visual-studio-subscriptions-work-with-group-rules)
