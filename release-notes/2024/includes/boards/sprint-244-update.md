### Area and iteration level fields

Area and iteration level fields have long been a valuable part of the product, allowing users to query or display results based on the specific levels at which they are defined:

*(Root) Level 1 / Level 2 / Level 3 / etc.* 

Previously, these fields were only accessible to a select few organizations. We are pleased to announce that area and iteration level fields will now be available to all Azure DevOps organizations. These fields can be used in queries and displayed as backlog columns. However, please note that they are not supported in settings such as style rules, swim lane rules, card fields, and delivery plan fields.

This feature is only available in the [New Boards Hub preview](/azure/devops/release-notes/2022/sprint-202-update#new-boards-hubs-now-available-in-public-preview).
