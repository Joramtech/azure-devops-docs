### Enhanced tag management on work item form

Tag management in Azure Boards has been enhanced to provide a more streamlined experience. Deleted tags no longer appear in the suggested list on work item forms, ensuring that only active tags are displayed.

### Improved image support in work item comments

Weâ€™ve improved our support for pasting images into work item comments. You can now paste images directly from sources like Microsoft Teams, emails, and Word documents into the discussion section of a work item

### GitHub pull request insights

We've enhanced the integration between GitHub pull requests and Azure Boards. In addition to showing open and closed statuses, you can now see if a pull request is in draft mode, needs review, and Checks status. All without needing to open the pull request.

To enable this feature, make sure you go the Boards App in GitHub to accept the requested updated permissions for read and write access to Checks.
