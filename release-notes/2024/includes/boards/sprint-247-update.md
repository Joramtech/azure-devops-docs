### New REST API limit on work item comments

To enhance security, a new limit has been set on the number of comments that can be added to work items through the REST API. Each work item now supports a maximum of 1,000 comments via the API. This restriction applies solely to the REST API, and users can still manually add comments through the web interface, even beyond the 1,000-comment threshold.
