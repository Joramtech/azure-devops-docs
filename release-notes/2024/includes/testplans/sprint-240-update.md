### Test and Feedback extension in Manifest V3

We're excited to announce a new update to the Azure DevOps Test and Feedback extension! This upgrade transitions our implementation from Manifest Version 2 to Version 3, aligning with Google's deprecation schedule for Manifest V2.

While the extension's core features remain unchanged, this update improves security and performance. The updated extension will roll out gradually to both Chrome and Edge browsers over the coming weeks. We will monitor performance and feedback to ensure a smooth transition before expanding the rollout based on the results.

For more details, check out our recent blog post about this update. [Test & Feedback Extension in Manifest V3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/test-feedback-extension-v3/)
