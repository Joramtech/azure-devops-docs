### Security overview API documentation now available 

Documentation for the API powering the Advanced Security overview risk tab is now available. Use the endpoint `/{organization}/_apis/reporting/summary/alerts` to view a summary of alert criticality across all Advanced Security-enabled repositories. Ensure your ADO PAT has the `vso.advsec` permission, which grants the ability to read alerts, result instances, and analysis result instances.
