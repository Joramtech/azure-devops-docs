### Unskippable stages

You can use [YAML templates](/azure/devops/pipelines/security/templates) as a security mechanism, for example, to inject a stage that performs malware detection in all pipelines. However, Pipeline end users can choose which stages to run, potentially skipping the malware detection stage.

With this sprint, you can mark a YAML stage as unskippable using the new `isSkippable` property. By default, the value of this property is `true`. To prevent skipping a stage, set it to `false`, as shown in the example below:
``` yaml
- stage: sdl_check_stage
  displayName: SDL Stage
  isSkippable: false
  jobs:
  - job: sdl_check_job
    ...
```

These stages will always execute and can't be deselected in the _Stages to run_ configuration panel.
