### Announcing deprecation of Pipeline Tasks

Azure Pipelines has around 200 tasks [included in the product](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference). Many of those are versions of the same task e.g. AzurePowerShell@2 and AzurePowerShell@5. Our AzureFileCopy task even has 6 versions. Whenever we change the behavior of a task or the task is wrapping a new major version of a tool, we introduce a new task version. Recent examples are the [PublishToAzureServiceBus@2](/azure/devops/release-notes/2024/pipelines/sprint-240-update#publishtoazureservicebus2-task), [AzureFileCopy@6](/azure/devops/release-notes/2024/pipelines/sprint-236-update#new-azurefilecopy6-task-supports-secret-less-configurations) and [PublishCodeCoverageResults@1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/new-pccr-task) tasks.

To inform users they are using an older version of a task and may not be taking advantage of the latest functionality, we are deprecating some of the older tasks. Deprecated tasks will emit a warning and guidance on alternatives, their behavior is unchanged.
Deprecated tasks will ultimately get removed. However, we have no planned date for retirement for the tasks in the below list. Retirement of tasks will be communicated separately at a later time.

Here is the list of tasks deprecated and guidance on alternatives:

### The Pipelines agent will show warnings for agents running Operating Systems not supported by .NET 8

We will upgrade the Pipelines agent to be built with .NET 8 instead of .NET 6. To prepare customers who may be using older Operating Systems, we are showing pipeline warnings for agents running on an Operating System that is not compatible with .NET 8.
