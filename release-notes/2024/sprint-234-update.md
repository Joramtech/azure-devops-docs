# General availability of Workload identity federation for Azure Resource Manager service connections 

Weâ€™re excited to announce that Workload identity federation is now generally available in Azure Pipelines!
You can enjoy a streamlined experience without the need to manage secrets and certificates in Azure service connections.

With this update, we are also previewing a new feature as part of our enhanced GitHub integration with Azure Boards. You can now link directly to GitHub pull requests or commits. No more switching between windows or copy/pasting. Simply select the repository you want, find the pull request or commit you need, and link it!
