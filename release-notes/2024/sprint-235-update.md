# Show GitHub pull request details on linked work item (preview)

With this update, we've enhanced the way you can view GitHub pull request statuses within the Azure Boards work item. Now, you can quickly check if a pull request is in draft mode, pending review, or undergoing status checks. This enhancement lets you see beyond the simple open or closed statusesâ€”without having to open the pull request.

Additionally, we are excited to announce the Test Plan and Suite ID Search feature in Azure Test Plans! This update is part of our ongoing effort to improve your test management experience. 

Check out the release notes for details.
