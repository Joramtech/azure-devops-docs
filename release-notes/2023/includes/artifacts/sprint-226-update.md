### Introducing Azure Artifacts support for Cargo Crates (public preview)

We're excited to announce that Azure Artifacts now offer native support for Cargo crates.
This support includes feature parity with respect to our existing protocols, in addition to crates.io being available as an upstream source. Rust developers and teams can now consume, publish, manage, and share their Cargo crates seamlessly, all while using Azure's robust infrastructure and staying in the familiar Azure DevOps environment. 

No sign-up is needed for the preview; you can get started by navigating to your Azure DevOps project, selecting Artifacts, and following the instructions to connect your Rust project to your Azure Artifacts feed.
