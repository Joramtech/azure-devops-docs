### New Dashboard directory experience

We've listened to your feedback and are thrilled to introduce the new Dashboard directory experience. It not only features a modern UI design but also enables you to sort by each column, with the addition of the ***Last Configured*** column. This column will provide you with better insights into overall dashboard usage within your organization. Additionally, you can now filter by team or project-level dashboards, allowing you to access only the list of what you need to see while hiding the dashboards you donâ€™t want to view.
