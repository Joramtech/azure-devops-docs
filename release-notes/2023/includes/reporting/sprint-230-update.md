### Work item filtering

We are happy to announce **work item chart filtering.** This feature will let you hover over your work item chart for a quick overview and drill down into specific chart segments for detailed insights. You no longer need to create custom queries to access the exact piece of data you need. You can now dive into your work items in work item charts in a few clicks.
