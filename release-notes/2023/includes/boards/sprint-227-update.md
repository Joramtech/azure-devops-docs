### Limits for area and iteration paths

Limits play an important part in maintaining the health and efficiency of a large, global service. In this sprint, we are introducing hard limits of 10,000 per project for both area and iteration paths. Visit the [Work tracking, process, and project limits](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/object-limits?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true) page to learn more about different limits in the service.
